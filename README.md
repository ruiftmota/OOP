# OOP

This project presents a race simulator.
There are 3 configuration files:
  - carros.txt - cars configuration file
  - pilotox.txt - pilots configuration file
  - autodromos.txt - race tracks configuration file

In the begining the program loads all information. Then the user is responsible for associating the cars with the pilots, as well as choosing the track.
Finally the all the pilots compete based on their configuration an their vehicles as well as based on some user inputs that were required.

The files are just separated between header files and source files, as the program was of relatively simple and all classes are easily identifyable.

In order to run the project, there is no need an IDE, just to have gdb installed, and then run the scripts: 
  - compile_script.bat
  - run_script.bat
